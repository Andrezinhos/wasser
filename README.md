# Wasser Audio Engine

## Hello there

this project is a Audio Engine, that is based in terminal, using the SDL_mixer and the Mini Audio libraries
it works clear and it´s inspired by a project called "Music_Player"

it has to players based on the two libraries used in this project
for those who want a more complete experience, I recommend the SDL_mixer version

to use it, you need to add to the PATH, and to use the embedded player
run in the terminal "wasser mediakit" it will open it the SDL_mixer version
that's more complete and stable

to see the commands type "help" in the command line

it´s not fully complete, but its functional at least
