# Wasser Audio Engine

### Hello there

this project is an Audio Engine, that is based in terminal, using the SDL_mixer and the Mini Audio libraries
it works clear and it´s inspired by a project called "Music_Player"

it has two embedded players based on the two libraries used in this project
for those who want a more complete experience, I recommend the SDL_mixer version

to use it, you need to add to the PATH, and to use the embedded player
run in the terminal "mediakit run" it will open it the SDL_mixer version
that's more complete and stable

to use the version with the miniaudio library 
you could run with "mediakit river" and will open with the miniaudio version
is not the recommended for normal use, but for tests and development of the engine
is the best way

to see the actual version of the engine, type "mediakit --version"
and will show the actual version of the app you have

to see the commands type "help" in the command line

it´s not fully complete, but its functional at least
