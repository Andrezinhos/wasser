# Wasser Audio Engine

### Hello there

this project is an Audio Engine, using the SDL_mixer and the Mini Audio libraries
it works clear and it´s inspired by a project called "Music_Player"

it has an embedded player, that's terminal-based, with the name "MediaKit"
which could be removed if you want just the engine,
for those who want a more complete experience, use the version with the SDL_mixer

to use it, you need to add to the PATH, and to use the embedded player
run in the terminal "mediakit run" it will open it the SDL_mixer version
that's more complete and stable

to use the version with the miniaudio library 
you could run with "mediakit river" and will open with the miniaudio version called River
is not the recommended for normal use, but for tests and development of the engine is the best for it

to see the actual version of the engine, type "mediakit --version"
and will show the actual version of the app you have

to see the commands type "help" in the command line

it´s not fully complete, but its functional at least
